# DSApps @ TAU 2022: Final Project

### Welcome to the Final Project!

In general:

1. You need to have your own private repo of the final project.
2. Clone this repo locally.
3. The instructions are at [final_project_instructions.pdf](final_project_instructions.pdf). Start and fill your project notebook(s).
4. Push the repo back to Github before due date with the required pdf and csv files. If you've submitted early, might want to ping me.
5. You're done. :nail_care:
